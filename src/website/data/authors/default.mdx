As a solution/software architect, I am focusing on delivering robust, scaled platforms. I am responsible for understanding the goals; capturing, refining, and challenging the requirements and constraints on the client's question. I always ensure that technical architecture works and that we own the risks. As a solution/architect, I take leadership and ownership of the architecture throughout the software delivery and set the quality assurance by setting standards, guidelines, principles, my motto, 'Getting Things Done'.
